Needs checking:
1) Not sure if the arguments for the stft is correct - used the example code to fill in the gaps for now
2) Power-law compression? - as above, not sure about the formula (mu-law??)
3) Double check that input audio are indeed mono (by taking the left channel if stereo)
4) Convolution network - padding valid vs same? ; 'Context' in the table in the paper??
5) 

To be completed:
1) Dependencies list in readme may not be complete - but not too important atm
2)
